In this project, I have mainly focused on EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to check for relationship between crashes occured in the past and in the recent years.

The dataset will be provided in the file and is taken from the below link:
"https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/airline-safety"

The crashes of the airlines have been grouped into two time periods.

One is from 1985-1999 and the other one is from 2000-2014.

Since I have zero expertise on Aviation, I have just done some surface level EDA without going to deep on it.
